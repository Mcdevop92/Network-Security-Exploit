# Network-Security-Exploit 👨🏻‍💻🔓
 Used Kali Linux and Metasploitable 2 in VirtualBox to perform network reconnaissance and exploit vulnerabilities with Nmap and Metasploit.

## Goals 🎯
* Set up a virtual machine with Kali Linux and Metasploitavle 2
* Use `nmap` to check for open ports and port vulnerabilities
* Use the Metasploit Framework to run pre-made exploits

## Getting Started 🤓

1. Find the target IP address
   run metasploitable 2 and log in using msfadmin then type `ifconfig` 

   ex:

* we can see the inet addr (internet address) fields is 172.17.0.2
  * ⚠️ Your values might be different! Take a moment to write down the IP for eth0 on your Metasploitable, as you'll need it to target your attacks in the next step.
