# Network-Security-Exploit 👨🏻‍💻🔓
 Used Kali Linux and Metasploitable 2 in VirtualBox to perform network reconnaissance and exploit vulnerabilities with Nmap and Metasploit.

## Goals 🎯
* Set up a virtual machine with Kali Linux and Metasploitavle 2
* Use `nmap` to check for open ports and port vulnerabilities
* Use the Metasploit Framework to run pre-made exploits

## Getting Started 🤓

1. Find the target IP address
   run metasploitable 2 and log in using msfadmin then type `ifconfig` 

   ex:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8222203-4349-4a31-9756-511b4525c399)

* we can see the inet addr (internet address) fields is 172.17.0.2
  * ⚠️ Your values might be different! Take a moment to write down the IP for eth0 on your Metasploitable, as you'll need it to target your attacks in the next step.

2. The Recon
All right. Now let's perform some <b>reconnaissance</b>. Run Kali Linux and open the terminal, we can scan the target PC and see if we can find any vulnerabilities to exploit! We'll do this using popular networking tool <b>nmap</b>.
* On a Kali Linux terminal, run `sudo apt install -y nmap` to install `nmap`.
* Next, we'll perform a basic scan of the target Metasploitable container: `nmap -p0-65535 172.17.0.2`
   * The `-p0-65535` flag means "scan every port from 0 to 65535" -- all the possible ports.
 For this project we are going to focus on port `21`.
* Run `nmap` again but this time scan port 21 for vulnerabilities: `nmap 172.17.0.2 --script vuln -p 21`
We are looking for one specific vulnerability: <b>The `vsftpd` backdoor</b>

"On port 21, Metasploitable2 runs vsftpd, a popular FTP server. This particular version contains a backdoor that was slipped into the source code by an unknown intruder. The backdoor was quickly identified and removed, but not before quite a few people downloaded it. If a username is sent that ends in the sequence :) [ a happy face ], the backdoored version will open a listening shell on port 6200. We can demonstrate using the Metasploit Framework module to automatically exploit it."
