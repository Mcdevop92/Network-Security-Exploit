# Network-Security-Exploit 👨🏻‍💻🔓
 Used Kali Linux and Metasploitable 2 in VirtualBox to perform network reconnaissance and exploit vulnerabilities with Nmap and Metasploit.

## Goals 🎯
* Set up a virtual machine with Kali Linux and Metasploitavle 2
* Use `nmap` to check for open ports and port vulnerabilities
* Use the Metasploit Framework to run pre-made exploits

## Getting Started 🤓
### 1 - The Target

Find the target IP address
   run metasploitable 2 and log in using msfadmin then type `ifconfig`.

   ex:

* we can see the inet addr (internet address) fields is 172.17.0.2
  * ⚠️ Your values might be different! Take a moment to write down the IP for eth0 on your Metasploitable, as you'll need it to target your attacks in the next step.

### 2 - The Recon
All right. Now let's perform some <b>reconnaissance</b>. Run Kali Linux and open the terminal, we can scan the target PC and see if we can find any vulnerabilities to exploit! We'll do this using popular networking tool <b>nmap</b>.
* On a Kali Linux terminal, run `sudo apt install -y nmap` to install `nmap`.
* Next, we'll perform a basic scan of the target Metasploitable container: `nmap -p0-65535 172.17.0.2`.
   * The `-p0-65535` flag means "scan every port from 0 to 65535" -- all the possible ports.
 For this project we are going to focus on port `21`.
* Run `nmap` again but this time scan port 21 for vulnerabilities: `nmap 172.17.0.2 --script vuln -p 21`.
We are looking for one specific vulnerability: <b>The `vsftpd` backdoor</b>.

"On port 21, Metasploitable2 runs vsftpd, a popular FTP server. This particular version contains a backdoor that was slipped into the source code by an unknown intruder. The backdoor was quickly identified and removed, but not before quite a few people downloaded it. If a username is sent that ends in the sequence :) [ a happy face ], the backdoored version will open a listening shell on port 6200. We can demonstrate using the Metasploit Framework module to automatically exploit it."

### 3 - The Tool
We're going to use one of the most powerful penetration testing tools out there: <b>Metasploit<b/>.

* Run `msfconsole`  in Kali Linux terminal to launch metasploit
   *  ⚠️ Metasploit is going to take over your terminal window... so if you need your terminal back, you'll have to either quit Metasploit or open a 3rd console!
### 4 - The Exploit
Metasploit has a giant library of different exploits it can run. We want to exploit ` vsftpd`.
 * earch for an appropriate exploit by running search `vsftpd`

ßThere is a module that got a rank of excellent which means that it works reliably!
* Load the module with use `exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor`
(Upon loading our exploit, the first thing Metasploit will do is give you the following message: `[*] No payload configured, defaulting to cmd/unix/interact`)
That's fine for this exploit, but if you try others, keep in mind you may need to modify the payload! You can read more about it on the Metasploit docs --> https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/basics/how-payloads-work.html.

### 5 - Potential Mitigations
